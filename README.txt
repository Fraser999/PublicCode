This space is meant to keep a track of different problems I have solved over time.

Code can be in different languages: C++/JAVA/C#/python etc

- data_structures : From basic to complex data structures, e.g. LinkedList, Trie etc
- snippets: Targetting specific tasks, such as, converting infix expression to postfix expressions
- projects: Implementing a more abstract problem. e.g.: cache system, expression evaluator etc
